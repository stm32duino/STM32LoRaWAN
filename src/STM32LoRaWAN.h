     * @anchor joinOTAA
     * @name OTAA Join
     *
     * This method can be used to join the network using the OTAA
     * (over-the-air-activation) method, where the device uses the
     * credentials specified here to negotiate a session (including
     * session address and encryption keys) with the network by
     * exchanging messages.
     *
     * The appEUI and appKey are mandatory, the devEUI can be omitted,
     * in which case the devEUI baked into the chip is used.
     *
     * For both EUIs and the key, you can pass a hex-encoded (MSB-first)
     * string (`String` object or `const char*`), for the EUIs also
     * a raw integer (64-bits).
     *
     * These methods will perform multiple join attempts and block until
     * the join completes successfully, or a timeout (60 seconds) occurs.
     *
     * There are some subtle differences with MKRWAN in how the join
     * process works:
     *  - MKRWAN returns directly after the timeout, while this library
     *    finishes the running join attempt before joinOTAA returns.
     *  - With MKRWAN the module continues doing join attempts in the
     *    background, while this library stops attempting them after
     *    joinOTAA returns.
     *  - With MKRWAN the module automatically decreases/alternates the
     *    datarate in a region-specific way for all regions, this
     *    library uses the configured datarate (with `datarate()`) for
     *    most regions, but uses fixed datarates (according to LoRaWAN
     *    regional parameters) for US915/AU915/AS923.
